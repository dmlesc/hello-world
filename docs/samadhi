Feel this imagined breathing coming straight up and into the bottom of the pelvis,
and going straight down and out from the bottom of the pelvis. Now, squeeze your
perineum tight. Contract the entire pelvic floor. This is called a mula bhanda
(Sanskrit for 'root lock') in hatha yoga. Breathe in and out once or twice through
the bottom of the pelvis, with labeling, while maintaining this contraction.

Loosen the squeeze until it's only about two percent of the full contraction and
maintain it at this level. When any tension arises anywhere else in the body, note
it, and then release it, while maintaining this two percent hold. Continue breathing
through the bottom of the pelvis with labeling. Eventually, but don't be in any
hurry to get there, loosen this 2% hold to a .2% hold and then a .02% hold. After
applying some of the following directions, loosen the hold to .002% Maintain this
.002% lock for the rest of the practice. Don't forget it as this grounds the energy
so it can build.

Holding the lock to any degree, by .002% which is just the stored impetus to do so,
activates the connection between mind and body. It becomes a natural response. It's
the 'base' of balance. As such, it gets absorbed into the much stronger 'sign born
of perception'. The strengthening of the sign occurs from successfully creating
and storing the energy due to this activation. If or when the sign emerges, holding
the lock is no longer consciously necessary as one then works with the sign.

Sweep the entire body up and down in this fashion repeatedly.
Take your time to fully establish the sensation.

Again, widen your mental peripheral vision. Feel the breathing coming from every
direction into the center of the heart and out from the center of the heart into
every direction. Expand your range of focus to include the whole body while maintaining
the center of awareness at the heart.

breathing in --> out through
  whole body --> whole body

Practice this repeatedly. At this point, you'll have been sitting for at least a
half an hour or probably more if you've been taking your time not to rush while
attending to the different centers of focus. This is a practice. There isn't a
destination other than a phenomenon, 'the sign born of perception', will arise in
one of the areas you've been breathing through when you do it carefully. Take this
phenomenon as the center of awareness and extend it into the other areas using the
breath as the vehicle. When the mind wanders note it with a simple label like "thinking."
Deal with these distractions the same as when you note any tension arising. Return
to any center where you strongly felt the attention penetrating it. Re-establish
the connection with the labeled breathing before again extending the attention
through the body. Eventually, at some point, as stated before, you'll be able to
take this sign as the object of awareness itself and absorb fully into it via the
breathing. You may now give the breath a quality if you so wish. This quality can
also become a spreadable sign. Whatever label has the most meaning to you will keep
the quality increasing.

"Calming the whole body breathing in. Calming the whole body breathing out." is
simple. "Feeling peace in the whole body breathing in. Feeling peace in the whole
body breathing out." is another way of working with it. Experiment with what is
most pertinent to you without distracting yourself with creative labeling just for
the sake of it. "Feeling energizing bliss through the whole body breathing in,
feeling energizing blissâ€¦ breathing out." can work too. It just needs to be a
desirable quality with labeling you can relate to. "Healing the body breathing in.
Healing the body breathing out." is a useful, practical application of a generated
quality.

Focusing on any of the locations or a generated quality using the breath as a
vehicle for the attention can lead to a full absorption of awareness to the first
degree, called first jhana in Pali. It's accompanied by and due to five factors:
applied thought, sustained thought, happiness, bliss, and one-pointedness.
